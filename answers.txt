Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We use Git for version control to track changes in code, collaborate efficiently with teams, and maintain a history of modifications. It enables branching, merging, and rollback to previous versions, preventing data loss and conflicts. Git also integrates with platforms like GitHub for remote collaboration and code management.
